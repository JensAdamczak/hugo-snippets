# Hugo Snippets - [Demo](https://jensadamczak.github.io/hugo-snippets/)

A minimal Hugo theme to publish notes and posts. It is based on the general layout of the [Hugo
Paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) theme. Changes consist in a re-work of the CSS and
design elements as well as an automatic categorization overview for posts in the About section.

The repository consists of three branches to
- store the source code of the theme [master](https://github.com/JensAdamczak/hugo-snippets)
- store the source code of an example site
  [example-site](https://github.com/JensAdamczak/hugo-snippets/tree/example-site)
- host the published website of the example site
  [gh-pages](https://github.com/JensAdamczak/hugo-snippets/tree/gh-pages)

For more details about the branches and the theme check the
